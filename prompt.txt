INTRODUCTION

All conference materials will be based on electronically

submitted documents in a PDF version only. Contact

Martina-M. Seidel at ecms@scs-europe.net, if you have

problems with that.

The Proceedings will be printed by reproducing a print

of the manuscripts submitted by the authors. It is

important to note that the appearance of your paper in the

Proceedings will depend largely upon the care you take

in preparing the original manuscript and graphic material.

You are responsible for all proofreading and layout

(this should be conformed with the author kit, if not,

your paper might not be accepted).

FORMATTING THE MANUSCRIPT

1. Manuscripts must be formatted two columns to a

A4-Format page (21 x 29.7cm =

8,26x11,69in). ALL FONTS NEED TO BE

EMBEDDED to ensure your paper can be published

in the proceedings. HOW EMBEDD FONTS link

Any OTHER FORMAT NOT BE ACCEPTED !!!!!!

2. We suggest you choose Times New Roman 10-

point type as font for your document.

3. The basic page size discussed hereafter, is the

standard European A4-Format page (21 x 29.7

cm= 8,26x11,69in). Set your paper size to A4, and

set the left and right margins to 2 cm. Set the

top and bottom margins to 2.5 cm. The text

must be justified and divided into two equal

columns with 1 cm separation (implying a column

width of 8 cm per column).

4. Text should be single-spaced, with double spacing

between paragraphs, and with a 3-space paragraph

indentation.

5. The title and author information, on the first page

should be centered.

KEYWORDS

Model, π in the C-Ky, X-Y-Z Analysis.

ABSTRACT

Begin each paper with an abstract (100-200 words) that

summarises the topic and important results presented in

the paper. It should start in the left column,

approximately 7cm from the top edge of the paper, and

2cm from the left edge. Include the abstract heading as

shown. Use the bold version of your font and type in caps.

Skip a line space, then begin the abstract at the left

margin. The abstract should preferably not contain

formulas, pictures, or references.

PREPARING THE REMAINING PAGES

For the remaining pages follow the general guidelines

below:

MAJOR HEADINGS

Type in capitals, beginning flush with left-hand margin.

Use a bold font. Skip half a line space, then begin.

Subheadings

Capitalise the first letter of each word, beginning flush

with left-hand margin. Use a bold font. Skip half a line

space, then begin.

Secondary Subheadings

Try to avoid secondary subheadings as much as possible.

These should not be necessary in a 7- or 10-page paper.

Use the standard font or the italic version of the font (in

this case Times Italic 10). Capitalise the first letter of

each word. Text follows on the next line, do not skip a

line space.

MATHEMATICAL NOTATIONS AND

EQUATIONS

Each displayed equation should be proceeded and

followed by a half blank line. Display only the most

important equations and number only the displaced

equations that are explicitly referenced within the text.

Within the display enclose the equation number in

parentheses and place it flush with the right-hand margin

of the column, for example:

x(t) = A(t)x(t) + w(t) + u(t) (1)

Within the text each reference to an equation number

should also be enclosed in parentheses as in this reference

to Equation (1) above. The equation should preferably

also be 10 points.

TABLES AND ILLUSTRATIONS

All artwork, captions, graphics, and tables will be

reproduced exactly as you submit them. To ensure

quality of reproduction, do the following test. Make a

photocopy of a photocopy of the original. If this 2nd

copy is still legible, it will be faithfully reproduced in

the Proceedings.

Figures and tables should be centred within a column. A

figure or table that is wider than one column may be

centred between the columns, but it should not extend

beyond the column edges A figure or table that is wider

than both columns should be set landscape. The top of the

figure or table should be aligned with the left-column

edge, and it should occupy the entire page (but not

outside the 24,7cm by 17cm rectangle).

Figures and tables are numbered sequentially, but

separately using Arabic numerals Figures should appear

following the paragraph on which the figure is first

referenced Centre the figure number and the caption

under the figure using the following format.

Figures 1: Capitalise Caption with No-Period

Tables should appear in the document following the

paragraph in which the table is first referenced. Centre

the table number and the caption above the table using

the following format.

Captions for figures and tables should be written in

heading style. That means only important words are

capitalised.

If you include photographs or screen-dumps insert

them electronically or paste electronically them into

place. You can use colour illustrations in your text.

When using Microsoft Word™ do not anchor your

pictures, graphs or illustrations, to a particular

location in your text, as when sent electronically this

position can shift. Colour will be reproduced only on

the CD-ROM version of your paper – make sure that

the black/white version of the paper is also readable.

FOOTNOTES AND ENDNOTES

Do not use footnotes or endnotes, instead incorporate

such material into the text directly or parenthetically. If

you want to acknowledge a grant or support, include an

extra acknowledgements section at the end of the paper.

REFERENCES

In text, references should be cited by the last name of the

author and the year of publication, all in parentheses. The

Reference List should be organised alphabetically by

the name of the author, followed by the author's initials,

year of publication, and other complete information

about the published work. It may not be numbered.

Only references that may be readily obtained should be

cited in the list. Others may be referred to as "personal

communication" in the text. In the reference list, multiple

entries with the same author are arranged

chronologically. Italicise the name of the publication in

which the article is found, or the title itself if a separate

publication. For laboratory, company, or government

reports, all information on how to obtain the report

should be included. For Ph.D. and M.S. theses, the

institutions granting the degree should be given.

References to proceedings must include the full name

of the proceedings, how to obtain it, year of publication,

and page numbers of article cited. A reference to part of

a book must include the range of pages in which the

material is cited. Names of periodicals must be written

out in full, and the range of pages cited. Citing websites

as references should not be done.

Examples of References

In text:

(Balci, 1985) – one author

(Balci and Sargent, 1981) – two authors

(Felker et al., 1980) – more than two authors

(Hawking, 1982a) – a trailing lowercase letter should

distinguish multiple papers by the same author(s)

published during a single year (also in the references

section)

(Balci and Sargent, 1981; Hawking, 1982b; Gass, 1978)

– more references

In reference List (a 9-point font is standard for the

reference list):

The examples below show what a reference should look

like in a journal (Balci and Sargent 1981), for a book

(Felker et al. 1980), for a book chapter (Balci and Sargent

1983), in a conference proceeding (Gass 1978), for a

special publication (National Bureau of Standards 1976),

for a technical report (Balci 1985), and for an internal

report (Inglehart and Shedler 1983)

GENERAL GUIDELINES TO IMPROVE THE

CONTENTS OF YOUR FINAL PAPER

Please take note of these comments before writing

your paper

1. Always state the relation with the simulation or

related field throughout your entire paper. The

relation can be threefold: your research is on

simulation itself, your research using simulation in

another field, or your research contributes to the

field of simulation.

2. If your paper describes a method or a technique,

always give examples of the use of that method or

technique. If possible, include (references to)

empirical evidence that your method or technique

works the way it is supposed to.

3. If your paper describes an application example,

always point out the methods and techniques you

used to get the results that are described in the

paper. Add screen-dumps if possible. Literature

references might be sufficient.

4. Give an indication of the current stage your work or

research is in. Is it still preliminary? Is there a

commercially available product on the market? Is

your work being applied by others or in other

domains?

5. Start your paper with a brief abstract. Do not

include material in the abstract that will not be

described in the paper.

6. Always indicate the novel aspects that will be

covered in the paper with respect to earlier work of

yourself and of others. In what way does your

contribution differ from what has been done before?

7. Make sure your introduction is appropriate. An

introduction should give the general background for

your research, and references to general literature

on the subject for interested readers.

8. Make sure your literature references are correct,

and up-to-date. Others will use your paper to find

more information on the subject your paper is about.

Do not only use your own references, but also

refer to work done by others.

9. End your paper with conclusions and further

research and recommendations. Your conclusions

must be based on the material that can be found in

the paper!

10. If you are not a native English speaker, have your

English corrected before you send in your final

paper. If the use of the English language is below

standards, your paper might be rejected. The text

should be written in British English.

AUTHOR BIOGRAPHIES

Please include a brief biography (no more than 300

words) of all authors at the end of the manuscript. The

section heading is AUTHOR BIOGRAPHIES. This

allows the viewing and reading audience to become

familiar with the background of the authors, thus giving

the paper greater impact and validity.

Start the paragraph devoted to each author's name,

without indentation. In boldface FULL CAPITALS. If

there are multiple authors, separate each paragraph with

a blank line. Authors are encouraged to include email and

web address in the last line of the biography.

If space permits, a small picture of 1.5 x 2 cm can be

included as shown below.

JOHN J. SMITH was born in

Antwerp, Belgium and went to the Free

University of Brussels, where he studied

chemical technology and obtained his

degree in 1973. He worked for a couple of

years for the Brussels Chemical Company

Actin before moving in 1986 to the

University of Anytown where he is now leading a large

research group in the field of simulation for X-Y-Z

Analysis. His e-mail address is:

JJSmith@anytown.com and his web page can be found
